# React + TypeScript + Vite

System Information Dashboard
A React-based web application that provides detailed system information about your hardware and software components, including CPU, memory, storage, operating system, graphics, battery, processes, and more. The app displays real-time data, allows searching for more information, and links to related resources on Google and Amazon.

Features
View system information like CPU, memory, OS, battery, GPU, and more.
Real-time data fetching from your system.
Detailed specifications displayed with helpful information chips.
Search for system components on Google and Amazon directly from the UI.
Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
React: The frontend framework for building the user interface.
Material-UI: A popular React UI framework for building beautiful and responsive layouts.
Redux: For state management to handle system information and loading states.
TypeScript: Provides static typing to catch errors early and improve development productivity.
Redux Toolkit: Simplifies Redux usage and optimizes code for better maintainability.
Axios: To fetch system information from the backend or local API.
Google & Amazon Search APIs: Links to search for system components on external sites.
Installation

How It Works
System Information Fetching
The application fetches system information using a custom API or service that gathers details such as CPU, memory, battery, graphics, etc.
The information is then displayed in an organized and user-friendly manner with cards and chips.
If the information is unavailable, the app shows a helpful message explaining the possible issue.
Search Functionality
Users can click the search buttons to look for more information about a component on Google or find relevant products on Amazon.
The search functionality is dynamic, based on the component type (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory) and searches using the most relevant terms for better results.
Folder Structure
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the folder structure:

bash

/src
/components
Home.tsx # Main component that displays the system information
InfoCard.tsx # Card component for displaying individual hardware info
/redux
/slices
systeminfo.ts # Redux slice to manage the state for system info
store.ts # Configures the Redux store
/services
api.ts # API or service to fetch system information (if applicable)
/styles
theme.ts # Custom theme for Material-UI
App.tsx # Main entry point for the React app
index.tsx # Renders the app to the DOM
tsconfig.json # TypeScript configuration file

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from "eslint-plugin-react-x";
import reactDom from "eslint-plugin-react-dom";

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    "react-x": reactX,
    "react-dom": reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs["recommended-typescript"].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
});
```
